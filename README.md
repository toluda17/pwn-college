Welcome! This repo chronicles my step-by-step progression through PWN College — the hands-on, practical cybersecurity training platform.

Here, I document:
- Challenges I’ve solved
- Key commands and techniques learned
- Reflections and lessons from each module
- My growing skills in binary exploitation, Linux, and system security

I’m building this both as a personal learning log and a portfolio to share with future employers and collaborators.

Let’s dive in!
