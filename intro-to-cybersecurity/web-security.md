I'm now starting the Web Security module on Pwn College.

In this section, I’ll be learning about common web vulnerabilities, how they work, and how to exploit them in controlled environments. I’m aiming to strengthen my understanding of how web applications can be attacked — and ultimately, how they can be better defended.

Let’s begin.

# CHALLENGE 1: PATH TRAVERSAL
"This challenge explores how naive Linux path resolution can be abused via crafted web requests. The goal is to trick a basic web server into serving unauthorized files — specifically, the flag.

You're given a custom server binary located at `/challenge/server`, which serves files from `/challenge/files` over HTTP. Run it like any normal challenge, then interact with it using a browser or tools like `curl`."
